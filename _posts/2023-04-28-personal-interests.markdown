My personal interests and hobbies (when work/school schedule permits) cover the following topics:

- Amateur Radio
  + HF digital modes [WSPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSPR_(amateur_radio_software)), [WSJT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSJT_(amateur_radio_software))
- Autonomous robotic spatial awareness and mobility (Currently using OpenCV's OAK-D Lite [link](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d-lite-1))
