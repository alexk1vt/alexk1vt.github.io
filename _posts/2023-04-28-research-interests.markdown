My current research focus is security in space networks.  This includes both LEO mega-constellation networks (ie, Starlink) and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) operating in cislunar and beyond.

Prior research topics included:
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection on Windows hosts
- Botnet agent activity detection using Linux containers (LXC)

Additionally, I have also researched the viability of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) single-board computer (SBC) in low-earth-orbit, specifically with the Raspberry Pi 3 Compute Module.
