My current research focus is security in space networks.  This includes both LEO mega-constellation networks (ie, Starlink) and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) operating in cislunar and beyond.

Security in the context of space networks can be pretty broad, with topics ranging from:
- Network coverage in the event of unscheduled satellite losses
- Resiliency of data routing in the event of unscheduled satellite losses
- Authenticity of administrative network traffic

Many standard security assumptions do not apply to non-terrestrial based networks that challenge simple reapplications of terrestrial network protocols to the space environment.  Additionally, as space network traffic reaches further away from Earth, link characteristics change drastically where many terrestrial network protocols breakdown.  The unique characteristics of the space environment and the spacecraft that operates there place additional operating constraints on space networks.  All of these features add up to a very exciting domain of computational and network research!

Prior research topics included:
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection on Windows hosts
- Botnet agent activity detection using Linux containers (LXC)

Additionally, I have also researched the viability of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) single-board computer (SBC) in low-earth-orbit, specifically with the Raspberry Pi 3 Compute Module.
